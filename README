ctcs2 is an alternative to Dennis Holmes's CTorrent Control Server.  It aims
for efficiency, simple extensibility and clarity of code.

PREREQUISITES
-------------

ctcs2 is written in Perl: you'll need a Perl interpreter on your system to run
it.  It has been developed against Perl 5.8 on FreeBSD, Linux and Mac OS X and
makes use of only standard modules.

There's nothing that stops it from working on Windows using Cygwin or
ActivePerl, but I haven't tested either except in the most superficial
capacity.

GETTING STARTED
---------------

At the command prompt:

perl -T ctcs2 --port=8080

ctcs2 runs in the foreground, so you'll probably want to make use of something
like daemontools (http://cr.yp.to/daemontools.html) or GNU screen
(http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/).

Run ctcs2 with the --help switch to see available command line options.  There
aren't that many.

If you use ctcs2 and like it/hate it/have improvement suggestions, please drop
me a note at dannywoodz@yahoo.co.uk.

API
---

The CTCS2 folder contains API.pm which, as the name suggests, provides programmers
with a simple, object oriented interface to a running CTCS2 server.  It's currently
incomplete, but I will be adding to it over time.  To use it, ensure that the folder
containing the CTCS2 folder is in your PERL5LIB path, and simple 'use CTCS2::API;'
from within your Perl script.
